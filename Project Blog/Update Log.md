## Update 0.0  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.10.2018
#### Software Designing:
- Our team started the project with a quick brainstormed about the topic of our project.
- After the decision was made we thought about our apps criteria using the moscow model and started with the SRS document.

## Update 0.1  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18.10.2018
#### Software Designing:
- We finished the SRS Document, which is containing our criterias subdivided with the MoSCoW Method, the Use Case Diagram and our functinal/nonfunctional requirements. 
- We started with the HLD document by starting with some of the UML Diagrams.

#### Programm:
- We started with figuring out a Layout by brainstorming about it.
- We can already add new items, trace and change the progress and decide between adding a new movie or series item.
- We researched the IMDb and started to figure out how we can use the information from this database to fill in the attributes of the items.

## Update 0.2  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 29.10.2018
#### Software Designing:
- We finished drawing the UML-Diagrams for the HLD document by hand and with Visio. We worked on the HLD document and are now nearly finished with it.

#### Programm:
- With the program it is now possible to read (input) and auto-save (output) the OMDb movie data file. 
- In addition the program makes an automatic generation of instances from the OMDb movie data file. 
- An instance contains all information about one movie or series. 
- By now the OMDb can be searched by IMDb ID and the UI instance is being filled by automatic generation with the fitting OMDb instance. 
-This week we completed the pre-alpha of the UI. 
- It is also possible by now to highlight an instance by moving the cursor on it.

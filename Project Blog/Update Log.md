## Update 0.0  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.10.2018
#### Software Designing:
Our team started the project with a quick brainstormed about the topic of our project.
After the decision was made we thought about our apps criteria using the moscow model and started with the SRS document.

## Update 0.1  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18.10.2018
#### Software Designing:
We finished the SRS Document, which is containing our criterias subdivided with the MoSCoW Method, the Use Case Diagram and our functinal/nonfunctional requirements. 
We started with the HLD document by starting with some of the UML Diagrams.
#### Programm:
We started with figuring out a Layout by brainstorming about it.
We can already add new items, trace and change the progress and decide between adding a new movie or series item.
We researched the IMDb and started to figure out how we can use the information from this database to fill in the attributes of the items.

## Update 0.2  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 29.10.2018
#### Software Designing:
We finished drawing the UML-Diagrams for the HLD document by hand and with Visio. We worked on the HLD document and are now nearly finished with it.
#### Programm:
With the program it is now possible to read (input) and auto-save (output) the OMDb movie data file. In addition the program makes an automatic generation of instances from the OMDb movie data file. An instance contains all information about one movie or series. By now the OMDb can be searched by IMDb ID and the UI instance is being filled by automatic generation with the fitting OMDb instance. This week we completed the pre-alpha of the UI. It is also possible by now to highlight an instance by moving the cursor on it.
